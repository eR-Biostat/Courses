# 1. Introduction

> "Exploratory data analysis can never be the whole story, but nothing else can serve as the foundation stone - as the first step"
>
> --- John W. Tukey (1977)


###  Location, Spread and Shape in univariate data

In this course, we focus on descriptive measures, numerical and graphical, to
characterize and visualize the features of a particular univariate distribution. 
The following three main factors are usually used to specify a particular distribution:

  * Location
  * Spread
  * Shape

Each of these control different characteristics of a distribution.


### R datasets for illustraions

In order to simplify the usage of slides, the data we used for illustrations are R datasets. We give a short description  of each data in the relevant slides.

# 2. Working with the <tt>ggplot2</tt> R package for vizualization

### The layers of a <tt>ggplot2</tt> figure 

A key idea behind <tt>ggplot2</tt> is that it allows to easily building up a complex plot layer by layer. Each layer adds an extra level of information to the plot. In that way we can build sophisticated plots tailored to the problem at hand. 


### The <tt>mtcars</tt> data 

The data gives information about fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

```{r,echo=TRUE}
head(mtcars)
```

For our example, we focus on <tt>mpg</tt>, <tt>hp</tt> and <tt>cyl</tt>.


### The <tt>mtcars</tt> data 


Bivariate data (miles/(US) per gallon, horsepower). We wish to produce a basic scatterplot: mgp Vs. h using the R function <tt>plot()</tt>.

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Miles/(US) per gallon vs. Horsepower"}
plot(mtcars$hp,mtcars$mpg)
```


### Linear regression 

We consider a simple linear regression model of the form
$$\mbox{mpg}_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1} \times \mbox{hp}_{i} + \varepsilon_{i}$$.
In R, we can fit the model using the <tt>lm()</tt> function.

```{r,echo=TRUE}
fit.lm<-lm(mtcars$mpg~mtcars$hp)
```

The fitted model

```{r,echo=TRUE}
summary(fit.lm)
```


### First layer: basic plot 

Basic plot using <tt>ggplot2</tt>, scaterplot and labels.

```{r, echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Miles/(US) per gallon vs. Horsepower"}
library(ggplot2)
gg <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) +
        geom_point() +
        labs(x = "Horsepower",y= "Miles Per Gallon")
gg
```



### What is <tt>aes()</tt> function?

The <tt>aes()</tt> function is a generate **aesthetic** mappings that describe how variables in the data are mapped to visual properties (Aesthetics) of geoms. The <tt>aes()</tt> is a quoting function. This means that its inputs are quoted to be evaluated in the context of the data. For example, in Figure 2 we use <tt>aes(hp, mpg)</tt>. This means that we specify the vraiables <tt>mpg</tt> and <tt>hp</tt> to be used in the plot. For more details use the <tt>ggplot2</tt> Cheat Sheet: [ggplot2](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/UG/SM/STAT3022/r/current/Misc/data-visualization-2.1.pdf).

### Second layer: add Cylinders information 

We wish to add colors to the data points (by Cylinders number), we use <tt>aes(color=as.factor(cyl)), size=5</tt>.

```{r,echo=TRUE,,fig.cap="Miles/(US) per gallon vs. Horsepower"}
library(ggplot2)
gg <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) +
        geom_point(aes(color=as.factor(cyl)), size=5) +
        labs(x = "Horsepower",y= "Miles Per Gallon",color= "# of Cylinders")
gg
```


### The <tt>geom()</tt> function 

A ggplot2 <tt>geom</tt> "tells" the plot how do we want to display the data in R. For example, <tt>geom_bar()</tt>  makes a bar chart while <tt>geom_point(aes(color=as.factor(cyl)), size=5)</tt> produces a scaterplot with points. Note that <tt>aes(color=as.factor(cyl))</tt>: uses different colors acording to the <tt>cyl</tt> levels.

### Third layer: change the background 

In order to change the theme (to make the figure clear) we use <tt>theme_bw()</tt>.

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Miles/(US) per gallon vs. Horsepower"}
library(ggplot2)
gg <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) +
        geom_point(aes(color=as.factor(cyl)), size=5) + labs(x = "Horsepower",y= "Miles Per Gallon",color= "# of Cylinders")+
        theme_bw()
gg
```


### Fourth layer: add the regression line 

To add a regression line we use <tt>geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)</tt>. To produce the figure we use

* <tt>ggplot(data,aes(variables))</tt>.
* <tt>geom_point(size)</tt>.
* <tt>aes(color the data points)</tt>.
* <tt>geom_smooth(add regression line)</tt>.
* <tt>labs(add labels)</tt>.


```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Miles/(US) per gallon vs. Horsepower"}
library(ggplot2)
gg <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) +
        geom_point(aes(color=as.factor(cyl)), size=5) + geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE) +
        labs(x = "Horsepower",y= "Miles Per Gallon", color= "# of Cylinders") +  theme_bw()
gg
```



### Fourth layer: add confidence intervals to the plot 

To add confidence internal around the regression line we use
<tt>geom_smooth(method="lm", se=TRUE)</tt>.

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Miles/(US) per gallon vs. Horsepower"}
library(ggplot2)
gg <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) + geom_point(aes(color=as.factor(cyl)), size=5) +
        geom_smooth(method="lm", se=TRUE) +
        labs(x = "Horsepower",y= "Miles Per Gallon",color= "# of Cylinders") +theme_bw()
gg
```

### Fifth layer: add a smoother 

A loess smother can be added using <tt>geom_smooth(method="loess"", se=TRUE)</tt>

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Miles/(US) per gallon vs. Horsepower"}
library(ggplot2)
gg <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) +geom_point(aes(color=as.factor(cyl)), size=5) +
        geom_smooth(method="lm", se=TRUE) + geom_smooth(method="loess",colour = "blue", size = 1.5)+
        labs(x = "Horsepower",y= "Miles Per Gallon",color= "# of Cylinders") + theme_bw()
gg
```

### Visualizing correlation patterns  across cylinders  


We can vizulaize how the dependence between mpg and hp changes with Cylinder numbers.

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Miles/(US) per gallon vs. Horsepower"}
qplot(hp,mpg,data = mtcars, colour = factor(cyl))+
geom_smooth(method = "lm",se = F)
```



# 3. Location

### Two normal densities

Location is the center of the distribution. Figure~XXX shows presents distributions with different locations, two normal densities with mean equal to 0 (the black line) and mean equal to 2 (the red line).

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Two normal densities"}
x<-seq(from=-5,to=5,length=1000)
dx1<-dnorm(x,0,1)
dx2<-dnorm(x,2,1)
plot(x,dx1,type="l")
lines(x,dx2,col=2)
```

### Two random samples

Figure~XX shows a histograms for two $random$ $samples$ drawn from normal distribution with the same variance but different  mean. Both histograms show that the data are symmetric around the sample mean but the histogram of $x_{2}$ is located to the right relative to the histogram of $x_{1}$. 


```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Two normal densities"}
x1 <- rnorm(10000, 0, 1)
x2 <- rnorm(10000, 2, 1)
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
hist(x1, col = 0, nclass = 50, xlim = c(-4, 6))
hist(x2, col = 0, nclass = 50, xlim = c(-4, 6))
```


#  4. Graphical displays for location

We focus of the follwoing queations:

* How can we visualize the distribution ?
* How can we visualize a shift in location ?
* Numerical summaries for location (look at the book): mean. median, trimmed mean...


```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Two normal densities"}
x<-seq(from=-5,to=5,length=1000)
dx1<-dnorm(x,0,1)
dx2<-dnorm(x,2,1)
plot(x,dx1,type="l")
lines(x,dx2,col=2)
```

###  The <tt>singer</tt> dataset

The singer datset (the R object <tt>singer</tt>) is a data frame giving the heights of singers in the New York Choral Society. The variables are named <tt>height</tt> (inches) and <tt>voice.part</tt> which is the voice group of the singer

   * Alto.
   * Sporano.
   * Tenor.
   * Bass.
   
Each voice group is subdivided into two groups, high voice and low voice (for example Bass1 and Bass2 and the lower and higher Bass voices, respectivly). Our main focus: the distribution of the singers' <tt>height</tt>.

###  The singer dataset

* The data:

```{r,echo=TRUE}
head(singer)
```

### Stripplot (using the <tt>lattice</tt> package)

In a **Stripplot** we plot the data of each voice group in a different strip. We use the syntax <tt>voice.part~height</tt>. In Figure~XX we can see a clear main pattern in the data: It is easy to distinguish between women (Sopranos and Altos) and men (Tenors and Basses). Women are clearly shorter than men.

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Stripplot"}
dotplot(singer$voice.part~singer$height, 
		aspect=1,
		xlab="Mean Height (inches)")
```

### Stripplot (using <tt>ggplot2</tt>): first layer

An equivalent stripplot can be produced using the <tt>ggplot()</tt> package. Using the function <tt>geom_jitter</tt> implies that observatios with the same values will be ploted side by side and will not overlap so sample size would be seen as well in the plot.  


```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Dotplot"}
ggplot(singer, 
       aes(voice.part,height)) + 
       geom_point()
```


```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Dotplot with jitter"}
ggplot(singer, 
       aes(voice.part,height)) + 
       geom_jitter(position = position_jitter(width = .05))
```



### Mean by voice group

In order to get a better insight of other patterns, we can summarize the distribution of each group with the sample mean. In R this can be done using the function <tt>tapply()</tt>. To calculate mean of height by the voice group in the singer dataset we use

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Stripplot"}
attach(singer)
tapply(singer$height,singer$voice.part,mean)
```

### Mean by voice group

The group means point on the pattern that was already detected: on average men are taller than women. In addition, we can see that within each gender group, singers with lower voice are taller than singers with higher voice.For example, the average of the two bass groups (71.38 and 70.71 for Bass 1 and Bass 2 respectively) are higher than the average in the tenor groups (69.90 and 68.90 for Tenor 1 and Tenor 2 respectively). 


### Mean by voice group

Among women, the sopranos are shorter, on average, than the altos. Within each voice group (all except the sopranos), the singers with lower voices (the second voice group Bass 2, Tenor 2 and Alto 2) are taller than the singers with the higher voices (the first group Bass 1, Tenor 1 and Alto 1). For example the mean of the Bass 2 group (71.38) is higher than the mean of the Bass 1 group (70.71)


### Stripplot (<tt>ggplot2</tt>): second layer

Figure~XX shows the same information as before with the addtion of the mean for each voice group. Note that we use the function <tt>stat_summary()</tt> with the option <tt>fun.y = "mean"</tt> to calculate the mean.


```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Stripplot"}
ggplot(singer, aes(voice.part,height)) +
geom_point() +
stat_summary(geom = "point", fun.y = "mean", colour = "red", size = 4)
```

### Boxplot (<tt>lattice</tt>)

Graphical display of the location of each distribution is the box plot. The location of each group is summarized by the median (the dot inside the box). Other aspects of this plot will be discussed in later chapters). Note that the function <tt>bwplot()</tt> is a part of the <tt>lattice</tt> package.


```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Boxplot"}
bwplot(as.factor(singer$voice.part)~ singer$height,
		data=singer,
		aspect=1,
		xlab="Height (inches)")
```		
### Multiway histogram (<tt>lattice</tt>)

The multiway histogram presents the distributions of heights across the voice groups. Note how the distribution of height is shiffted from left to right across the voice levels.

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Multiway histogram"}
histogram(~ singer$height | singer$voice.part,
		data=singer, layout = c(2, 4), 
		  aspect = 0.5,xlab = "height")
```


### Multiway histogram (<tt>ggplot2</tt>)

An equivalent multiway histogram can be produce with the <tt>ggplot2</tt> package.
We have addtional two layers in the basic plot: the first layer spacifys the plot type <tt>histogram()</tt> and the second layer indicates the factor for the plot partions. The function <tt>facet_wrap(factor)</tt>.is used to produce the histograms by voice group. 


```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Multiway histogram"}
ggplot(singer, aes(height)) +
geom_histogram() +
facet_wrap(~voice.part,ncol = 2)
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Multiway histogram"}
ggplot(singer, aes(height,fill = voice.part)) +
geom_histogram() +
facet_wrap(~voice.part,ncol = 2)
```

# 5. Spread

### Two normal densities

Figure~XXXX shows two normal densities that have different variability (or spread). * The density with the black line has variance 1 and density with the green line has variance 2.  

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Two normal densities"}
dx3<-dnorm(x,0,2)
plot(x,dx1,type="l")
lines(x,dx3,col=3)
```

### Spread in random samples

Two samples  were drawn from normal distribution with mean equal to 0 but with different variance. The two distributions have the same shape, both histograms are symmetric around 0 as expected. The spread in the histogram of $x_{2}$ is much higher than the spread in the histogram of $x_{1}$.

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Two normal densities"}
x1 <- rnorm(10000, 0, 0.75)
x2 <- rnorm(10000, 0, 2)
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
hist(x1, col = 0, nclass = 25, xlim = c(-4, 6), ylim = c(0, 1000))
hist(x2, col = 0, nclass = 50, xlim = c(-4, 6), ylim = c(0, 1000))
```
]


### Main concepts

Up till now we summarized the distribution of the data with location estimators.
In this chapter we focus on the spread. We want to measure how close the data are to each other and how concentrate the data around the center of the distribution. Numerical summaries for spread (see in the book):
 
    * The sample variance.
    * The fourth-spared.

  
Graphical displays for spread:
 
   * boxplot.
   * violin plot.
   

# 6. Boxplot: A graphical display for spread and location

A Boxplot is a graphical display which shows the location, the spread and the shape of the distribution. The location is summarized by the median, the spread is summarized by the fourth-spread which is simply the length of the box in the boxplot.
Inside the box: $50\%$ of the data.


```{r,echo=TRUE,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Histograms and boxplots"}
x1<-rnorm(1000,0,1)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(x1,main="random sample from N(0,1)",xlim=c(-10,10))
boxplot(x1,ylim=c(-10,10))
x2<-rnorm(1000,0,3)
hist(x2,main="random sample from N(0,9)",xlim=c(-10,10))
boxplot(x2,ylim=c(-10,10))
```

### Boxplot: A graphical display for spread and location

The upper and lower adjacent values in the boxplot are given by

$$\mbox{Upper adjacent value} = \textit{Min}  \left \{ max(X),Q_{3}+1.5(Q_{3}-Q_{1}) \right \}$$

$$\mbox{Lower adjacent value} = \textit{max}  \left \{ min(X),Q_{1}-1.5(Q_{3}-Q_{1}) \right \}$$

The upper and lower adjacent values are used to identify extrime values. 
Observations higher than the upper adjacent value or smaller than the lower adjacent value are considered to be outliers. 

### Example: the airqiality data

Daily air quality measurements in New York, May to September 1973. The histogram and boxplot for the airquality data: Ozone level. A skewed distribution with few outliers at the upper tail (histogram). In the boxplot these outliers can be identified above the upper adjacent value.

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Histogram and Boxplot"}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
airquality1<-na.omit(airquality)
hist(airquality1$Ozone)
boxplot(airquality1$Ozone)
```

ggplot(singer, aes(voice.part,height,fill=voice.part)) + geom_boxplot()
```

### Boxplot for the singers data

The data are added to the boxplot using the argument <tt>geom = c("boxplot", "jitter")</tt>.

```{r}
qplot(voice.part, height, data = singer, geom = c("boxplot", "jitter"))
```

### Violin plot for the singers data

When the argument <tt>geom_violin()</tt> is used instead of <tt>geom_boxplot()</tt> the boxplot  become a violin plot.

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Violin plot"}
ggplot(singer, aes(voice.part,height)) + geom_violin()
```

### Violin plot for the singers data

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Conbined violin and boxplot"}
ggplot(singer, aes(x = voice.part, y = height, fill = voice.part)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, color = "black", alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_minimal()
```

# 7. Shape: histograms and density edtimates

### Two densities

Figure ~XXXX shows two beta densities having diffent shapes. Black line: $Beta(2,2)$, red line: $Beta(2,4)$.


```{r figchp12i,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Shape"}
x<-seq(from=0,to=1,length=1000)
dx1 <- dbeta(x, 2, 2)
dx2 <- dbeta(x, 2, 4)
plot(x,dx1,type="l",ylim=c(0,2.5))
lines(x,dx2,col=2)
```


### Four random samples

4 samples (each with 10000 observations) that were drawn from different distributions. $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$: samples were drawn from symmetric distributions. 
The distributions of $x_{3}$ is skewed to the left and the distribution of $x_{4}$ to the right.

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Four densities"}
x1 <- rbeta(10000, 1, 1)
x2 <- rbeta(10000, 2, 2)
x3 <- rbeta(10000, 8, 3)
x4 <- rbeta(10000, 3, 8)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
hist(x1, col = 0, nclass = 50)
hist(x2, col = 0, nclass = 50)
hist(x3, col = 0, nclass = 50)
hist(x4, col = 0, nclass = 50)
```


### Density and density estimate

So far we used histogram to visualize the shape of the distribution of the observations in the sample. In this chapter we discuss density estimates as a method to estimate and visualized the distribution in the population.  

### Density and density estimate

A density function of $N(0,1)$ that represents the distribution of a random variable in the population. Suppose that we draw a random sample of size $n$ from the population. The histogram can be used to visualize the shape of the distribution. 
It is an estimate for the density in the population. 

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Four densities"}
x<-seq(from=-3,to=3,length=1000)
dx1<-dnorm(x,0,1)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(x,dx1,type="l")
title("a")
x1 <- rnorm(1000, 0, 1)
hist(x1, col = 0, nclass = 50, xlim = c(-3.5,3.5),main=" ")
title("b")
```

### Density and density estimate

A second approach to estimate the distribution of the population is to use a smooth version of the histogram, i.e., a density estimate. The density estimate for our example is shown (in red) panel c and d.

```{r ,,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Two normal densities"}
x<-seq(from=-3,to=3,length=1000)
dx1<-dnorm(x,0,1)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
#plot(x,dx1,type="l")
#title("a")
#x1 <- rnorm(1000, 0, 1)
#hist(x1, col = 0, nclass = 50, xlim = c(-3.5,3.5),main=" ")
#title("b")
dx2<-density(x1)
hist(x1, col = 0, nclass = 50, xlim = c(-3.5,3.5),main=" ",probability =T)
lines(dx2$x,dx2$y,col=2,lwd=2)
title("c")
plot(x,dx1,type="l",ylim=c(0,0.55))
lines(dx2$x,dx2$y,col=2,lwd=2)
title("d")
```

* A Web tutorial about the ridgeline chart using the <tt>ggplot2</tt> and <tt>ggridges</tt> package is given in the the R Graph Gallery website [WAVD4](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/ridgeline-plot.html).


#  8. The old faithful data

The data gives information about waiting time between eruptions and the duration of the eruption for the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA. We focus on two variables:
  
   * <tt>eruptions</tt>:	numeric,	Eruption time in mins.
   * <tt>waiting</tt>:	numeric,	Waiting time to next eruption (in mins)



```{r,echo=TRUE}
head(faithful)
```

Figure~xxx shows a Histogram of eruptions time and reveals a A bi-model. it was prduced using the <tt>hist()</tt> function, basic graphical function in R.


```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="The fathful data"}
hist(faithful$eruptions,nclass=20,col=2)
```


###  The old faithful data



It is an example for a failure of the boxplot to capture this feature (the bi-model) of the data .


```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="The fathful data"}
qplot(rep(1,length(eruptions)),eruptions, data=faithful, geom = c("boxplot"))
```

###  The old faithful data

We add the data to the boxplot, using the option <tt>geom = c("boxplot", "jitter")</tt> and we identify the two parts of the  eruptions time distribution.

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="The fathful data"}
qplot(rep(1,length(eruptions)),eruptions, data=faithful, geom = c("boxplot", "jitter"))
```


###  The old faithful data

The histogram is able to capture the shape of the distribution. 


```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="The fathful data"}
qplot(eruptions, data=faithful, geom="histogram")
```


###  The old faithful data

A density estimate was produced using the opion <tt>geom="density")</tt> provides a smooth estimate of the distribuon.

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="The fathful data"}
qplot(eruptions, data=faithful, geom="density")
```


###  The old faithful data

We can plot both histogram and density in the same plot.

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="The fathful data"}
hist(faithful$eruptions,nclass=15,probability = TRUE)
dx<-density(faithful$eruptions)
lines(dx$x,dx$y,lwd=2,col=2)
```



#  9. The singer data

###  The singer data

We use density plots to visualize the shit of the distribution of the singers' height across the voice part groups. The histograms ravel the shifts within and between the voice groups.


```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="The singers data"}
ggplot(singer, aes(height,fill = voice.part)) +
geom_histogram() +
facet_wrap(~voice.part,ncol = 2)
```

###  The singer data

In the density plots, The difference between the sopranos and altos (women singers, the densities in the left) and the tenors and basses (men singers, densities in the right) is clearly seen. The difference within each group is more difficult to detect. 
```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="The singers data"}
qplot(height, data=singer, geom="density", xlim = c(50,80),
fill = voice.part, alpha = I(0.2))
```

###  The singer data

A ridgeline charts visualizes the difference between the groups and within each voice group. Note that the R package <tt>ggridges</tt> should be instaled to produce the plot.

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="The singers data"}
library(ggridges)
ggplot(singer, aes(x=height,y=voice.part,fill = voice.part)) +
  geom_density_ridges() +
  theme_ridges() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```


# 10. Shape: the normal probability plot

###  Normal probability plot

A normal probability plot is a plot in which the quantile of the samples are plotted versus the corresponding quantiles of a standard normal distribution $N(0,1)$.In this chapter we discuss the normal probability plot as a graphical tools to vizualise the shape of a distribution. Using histograms and boxplots we are able to investigate the shape of the distribution focusing on the follwing issues:

  * How nearly symmetric the distribution of the data is.
  * Whether the distribution of the data is single-peaked, or whether it is multi-peaked.
  * Whether it is skewed.
  * How far we  from a Normal distribution ?
  

### Quantile of $N(\mu,\sigma^{2})$: Definition and a simple example

A qq normal plot is a graphical disply to investigate how now nearly is the sample to a normal distribution. Let $q_{\mu,\sigma}(f)$ be a quantile of $N(\mu,\sigma^{2})$, it can be expressed as

$$q_{\mu,\sigma}(f)=\mu+\sigma q_{0,1}(f).$$

For example, the $2.5 \% $ quantile of the standard normal distribution is -1.96. 

```{r,echo=TRUE}
qnorm(0.025,0,1)
```

For $N(2,5^{2})$ we have 

$$q_{2,5}(2.5 \% )=2+ 5 \times - 1.96=-7.8$$


```{r,echo=TRUE}
qnorm(0.025,2,5)
```


### YouTube tutorial: QQ-plots in RStudio

For a short online YouTube tutorials by UTSSC, about normal probability plot using R studio see [YTVD12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=louihSVsMC0).


### A sample from N(0,1)

We use the R function <tt>qqnorm()</tt> to produce the normal probabilty plot.
Data were sampled from $N(0,1)$. we expect that all points in the normal probability plot will lay on the on the $45^o$ line. 

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Normal probability plot"}
x <- rnorm(1000, 0, 1)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
hist(x, nclass = 25, col = 0)
boxplot(x, boxcol = 2, medcol = 1)
qqnorm(x)
abline(0, 1)
```

### A Sample from N(2,1)

A sample  from $N(2,1)$, i.e., it represents a shift model with the same variabiliy comapre to $N(0,1)$. In this case we expect that all points in the normal probability plot will lay above and parallel to the $45^{o}$ lines. 

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Normal probability plot"}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
x <- rnorm(1000, 2, 1)
hist(x, nclass = 25, col = 0)
boxplot(x, boxcol = 2, medcol = 1)
qqnorm(x)
abline(0, 1)
```

### A Sample from N(0,2)

The sample was drawn from $N(0,2^2)$ which implies that the mean is the same as $N(0,1)$ but the variability is higher. We expect the points in the normal probability plot to form a straight line with higher slope than 1.

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Normal probability plot"}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
x <- rnorm(1000, 0, 2)
hist(x, nclass = 25, col = 0)
boxplot(x, boxcol = 2, medcol = 1)
qqnorm(x)
abline(0, 1)
```

### A Sample from $t_{(3)}$

A $t_{(3)}$ distribution (red line) has the same mean as $N(0,1)$ but longer tails. 
Note that the two distribution and centered around zero. 


```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Normal probability plot"}
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
qx <- seq(from = -7, to = 7, length = 1000)
xn <- dnorm(qx, mean = 0, sd = 1)
xt <- dt(qx, 3)
plot(qx, xn, xlim = c(-7, 7), type = "l")
lines(qx, xt, col=2)
```

### A Sample from $t_{(3)}$

For the normal probability plot we expect that the points will lay on the $45^o$ line in the center but with more extreme values .

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Normal probability plot"}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
x <- rt(1000, 3)
hist(x, nclass = 25, col = 0)
boxplot(x, boxcol = 2, medcol = 1)
qqnorm(x)
abline(0, 1)
```




### A Sample from $t_{(3)}$


```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Normal probability plot"}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
x <- rt(1000, 3)
hist(x, nclass = 25, col = 0)
boxplot(x, boxcol = 2, medcol = 1)
qqnorm(x)
abline(0, 1)
```


### A Sample from $U(-3,3)$

The data of this example are uniformly distributed across the minimum and maximum values. We expect the points in the normal probability plot to cross the $45^o$ lines and to lay relatively far from the line.

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Normal probability plot"}
x <- runif(1000, -3, 3)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
hist(x, nclass = 25, col = 0)
boxplot(x, boxcol = 2, medcol = 1)
qqnorm(x)
abline(0, 1)
```

### A Sample from $U(-3,3)$

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Normal probability plot"}
x <- runif(1000, -3, 3)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
hist(x, nclass = 25, col = 0)
boxplot(x, boxcol = 2, medcol = 1)
qqnorm(x)
abline(0, 1)
```

* $N(0,1)$ ?
* $N(\mu,\sigma^{2})$ ?



```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.cap="Normal probability plot"}
qqnorm(mtcars$mpg)
```


###  The cars data

Normal probability plot for for the z-score  of mpg.

* $N(0,1)$ ?

m.mpg<-mean(mtcars$mpg)
sd.mpg<-sqrt(var(mtcars$mpg))
z<-(mtcars$mpg-m.mpg)/sd.mpg
qqnorm(z)
abline(0,1,col=2)
```

qqmath(~ height,
		distribution = qnorm,
		data=singer,
	       layout=c(1,1), 
             prepanel = prepanel.qqmathline,
            panel = function(x, ...) {
            panel.grid()

	       layout=c(4,2), 
             prepanel = prepanel.qqmathline,
            panel = function(x, ...) {
            panel.grid()
            panel.qqmathline(x, ...)
            panel.qqmath(x, ...)
            },
		aspect=1,
		xlab = "f-value",
		ylab="height")
```


# 13. Vizualizing caterogical data

### The Boston data

In this part , we focus on the Boston dataset which is a part of the MASS R package. The Boston dataset contains information about various attributes for suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. To access the data you need to install the package. More information can be found in https://www.statology.org/boston-dataset-r/. We use the code below to access the data.


```{r,echo=TRUE}
library(MASS)
data(Boston)
names(Boston)
```



### Categorical data

The variable <tt>crim</tt> is a numerical variable that give information about the  per capita crime rate by town. We define a new categorical variable <tt>crim_cat</tt> by Re-codeing the variable <tt>crim</tt> into three categories:

crim <5: Low.
crim 5-15: Medium.
crim >15: High.

```{r,echo=TRUE}
Boston3=Boston %>% 
  mutate(crim_cat=cut(crim,
             breaks = c(0, 5, 15, Inf),
             labels = c("Low",
                        "Medium",
                        "High")))
table(Boston3$crim_cat)
```


### Density plot

The variable <tt>age</tt> is the proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940. Similar to Section XX, we can vizualize the distribution of <tt>age</tt> across the categories of <tt>crim_cat</tt>.

```{r,echo=TRUE}
library(ggridges)
ggplot(Boston3, aes(x=age,y=crim_cat,fill = crim_cat)) +
  geom_density_ridges() +
  theme_ridges() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

### Pie chart for categorical data
