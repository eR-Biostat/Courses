## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
project_start <- params$start
summary(mtcars)
```

## Including project metadata: 

```{r date, echo=FALSE}
paste("Project Start Date:",project_start)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
plot(mtcars$wt,mtcars$mpg)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r,echo = FALSE}
plot(mtcars$wt,mtcars$mpg)
```


## Short Analysis 

```{r}
mean(mtcars$mpg)
fit.lm<-lm(mtcars$mpg~mtcars$wt)
```

## Output for the regression model

```{r}
summary(fit.lm)
```

## Output for the regression model


add `inline code` to make it more dynamic like `r pressure$temperature[5]*pressure$pressure[5]` or add ggplot

```{r ggplt, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
gg <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) +
        geom_point(aes(color=as.factor(cyl)), size=5) +
        geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE) +
        labs(x = "Horsepower",y= "Miles Per Gallon", 
             color= "# of Cylinders") +
        theme_bw()
gg
```
